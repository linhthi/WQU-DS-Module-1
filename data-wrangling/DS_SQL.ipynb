    "SQL is one of the most common computer languages in use for working with data today. It is a standardized language for accessing and manipulating relational databases. While it is relatively limited compared to a general programming language such as Python, it is highly optimized for efficient retrieval and aggregation of data from database tables. Its broad support and use virtually guarantees that any professional data scientist or analyst will encounter SQL eventually. Furthermore, SQL is often the paradigm used to discuss the relational data model, which has implications that apply beyond SQL compliant databases.\n",

    "The relational data model for the most part corresponds with our intuitive notion of a table. Each row is a **relation**, usually representing some object, event, or idea. Each column corresponds with an **attribute** which characterizes the relation. In order to reduce redundancy in a database, when creating at able we typically include the minimum amount of attributes required to fully define a relation. This (admittedly vague) guideline is formalized in the idea of [database normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).\n",
